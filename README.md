## PokéSpire Plugin
PokéSpire plugin is a cross-program mod that requires PokéOne in conjunction with TaleSpire to be installed to utilize this mod.
This allows users to import Pokémon into TaleSpire as usable minis.
For legal purposes this mod only references PokéOne files installed instead of packaging and re-distributing the needed files.
It is up to the users to obtain their own copy of PokéOne to reduce the mods legal lability on copyright and trademark infringement.

## Installing With R2ModMan
This package is designed specifically for R2ModMan and Talespire. 
You can install them via clicking on "Install with Mod Manager" or using the r2modman directly.
From there:
- Download and Install PokéOne and update to the latest version.
- Update Config to point to the root PokéOne folder where the Launcher.exe resides

## Installing Without R2ModMan (WIP)
You can still manually install this with the downloaded DLLs.
Upon doing so, you'll need to configure the plugin manual by updating the config file.

## Usage
Upon starting talespire an API call will be sent to Patreon to check your patronage level.
In GM mode, Right click on a mini and use the radial menu to "Set Pokémon".
From there you will get a list of Pokémon you can set.

Once a Pokémon is set they will have an additional Radial Menu to allow you to invoke animations such as:
- Attack
- Take Damage
- Faint
- Revive
